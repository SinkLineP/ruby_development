# Tic Tac Toe

## How it works

1. Choose Game Type: computer vs computer (cc) | human vs human (hh) | human vs computer (hc)
2. If human vs computer game - choose game level: easy (0) | medium (1) | hard (2)
3. Human Input Validation: only integers from 0 to 8

## Code Improvements: design and code style guide

1. Using Ruby code style guide to make code improvements
2. System Design - separate concerns: game, board, and players (computer | human)
3. Input Validator module: validation for game type and game level
4. Board management module: game over, tie, spot already chosen, print board current state
